## 📄 Practicals & 📘 Tutorials Tabs

![Practicals & Tutorials Tabs](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1xO8ZTjgIDtle_BWHwvaKsuvkjI4P0skD)

Once you're logged in, you will see Three main tabs:

- **Practicals Tab**
- **Tutorials Tab**
- **RAR Tab**

### 🔸 Interface Elements: Practicals Tab & Tutorials Tab

- 🏷️ **Label**

  Returns you to the **Login Page** immediately upon clicking.

- 👁️ **View Button**  
  Based on the selected **Course Category**, a list of practical or tutorial lessons is shown.  
  Each lesson has a **View** button to open its related **PDF file**.

---

## 🗂️ RAR Tab

![RAR Tab](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1xoipHAJnSr4cvEhn4gy7xKfzH28S462k)

The **RAR Tab** allows students to lock and archive their completed practical work using WinRAR.  
Buttons are dynamically displayed based on the selected **Course Category**.


### 🔸 How it Works:

For example, if you selected the course `DITEC`, you may see buttons like:

- `1. Information Technology`
- `1.1`
- `1.1.1`
- `1.1.2`

Each button corresponds to a folder created for that specific practical lesson.

### 🔐 RAR Button Behavior:

- When you click a button:
  - The system locates the relevant folder within your user directory.
  - The folder is then compressed and password-protected using **WinRAR**.
  - This ensures your completed practicals are **locked** and **preserved** from modification.

> 🛡️ Helps maintain academic integrity by securing finished work before submission.
